/* This question is asked by Facebook. Given a string and the ability to delete at most one character, return whether or not it can form a palindrome.
Note: a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.


"abcba", return true
"foobof", return true (remove the first 'o', the second 'o', or 'b')
"abccab", return false
*/

// check if it is palindrome
  // if so, is it odd?
    // if so, return true

// i - string
// o - bool
// c - hopefully not brute force time complexity
// e - empty string, string has length of one or two
