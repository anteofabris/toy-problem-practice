/*
This question is asked by Google. Given the reference to the root of a binary search tree and a search value,
return the reference to the node that contains the value if it exists and null otherwise.
Note: all values in the binary search tree will be unique.

Ex: Given the tree...

        3
       / \
      1   4
and the search value 1 return a reference to the node containing 1.
*/

var Tree = function (val, left, right) => {
  this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
  this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
  this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
}
